# SideScroller
*This repository is part of my primitive JavaScript projects. These projects were completed in the early stages of my learning, they do not use the best JavaScript practices, and do not always use the most appropriate algorithms. This specific project dates back to early 2018 and has many issues that can be fixed, but I may never fix them.*

This game is based on the popular game Geometry Dash. It uses structure similar to MineCraft to store 'tiles' in two dimensions, and to detect collisions and for other physics calculations. Only one playing level is complete, but included is a level builder which exports level tiles; these tiles can be put into code in the ```worlds.js``` file appropriately to be able to play.
